## Roll Call

Deployed at https://majozakidtracker.herokuapp.com/

## Description

Roll Call allows caregivers in a chilcare environment to keep a visual record of the children in their care, and to move children between caregivers, in real time.  While today's caregivers often have handheld technology at all times (tablets, phones), real-time student rolls are still kept on paper, if at all.  Our Roll Call app allows for easy and accurate records to be kept, on the fly.


### User Story

AS an educator and caregiver,
I want to clearly see which children I am responsible for
SO THAT I can better care for my students.
